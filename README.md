> Note: If you have trouble loading container, then you can run locally if you install have requirements installed.

# If you are using Windows, do not use PowerShell.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notes
- The test suite uses a small dynamic importer so filenames that start with digits can be loaded.
- If you prefer, you can rename files to valid module names (e.g., `selection_sort.py`) and import normally.
